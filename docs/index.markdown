<h4><strong>Where</strong> are India's trees?</h4><br>

<h4><strong>How are they changing</strong> over time?</h4><br>

<h4><strong>Who is publishing</strong> information on these?</h4>
</div>


### **The India Tree Inventory Network (INvenTree)** is collating tree inventory datasets from disparate datasets across the country towards syntheses that will benefit ecological research and researchers.


## How?

<strong>Collating</strong> tree data<br>

<strong>Collaborating</strong> among Indian scientists<br>

<strong>Distilling</strong> novel insights

## Why

Over the last few decades, Indian researchers have published *over 450 papers* using data from tree inventories across a large range of ecosystems.

These data have often been collected **using standard methodologies** and collectively span large space and time ranges. When synthesised, they can provide strong baselines and unmatched insights into Indiaâ€™s ecosystems, beyond the constraints that limit primary ecological data collection. 

**Widening access to these data**, we want to identify gaps and offer broad-scale insights for future forest conservation, management and restoration.
