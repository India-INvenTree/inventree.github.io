<div align="center">
<strong>Where</strong> are India's trees?<br>

<strong>How are they changing</strong> over time?<br>

<strong>Who is publishing</strong> information on these?
</div>

## Why

Over the last few decades, Indian researchers have published *over 400 papers* using data from tree inventories across a large range of ecosystems. Even more data languishes in the unpublished literature, such as environment impact assessment reports and masters’ theses.

These data have often been collected **using standard methodologies** and collectively span large space and time ranges. When synthesised, they can provide strong baselines and unmatched insights into India’s ecosystems, beyond the constraints that limit primary ecological data collection. 

**Widening access to these data**, we want to identify gaps and offer broad-scale insights for future forest conservation, management and restoration.
