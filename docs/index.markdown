<h2><strong>Where</strong> are India's trees?</h2><br>

<h2><strong>How are they changing</strong> over time?</h2><br>

<h2><strong>Who is publishing</strong> information on these?</h2>
</div>


## **The India Tree Inventory Database (INvenTree)** is collating information from disparate sources and developing a single open-access, searchable database of tree inventory datasets across the country.


## How?

<strong>Collating</strong> tree data<br>

<strong>Collaborating</strong> among Indian scientists<br>

<strong>Distilling</strong> novel insights

## Why

Over the last few decades, Indian researchers have published *over 400 papers* using data from tree inventories across a large range of ecosystems. Even more data languishes in the unpublished literature, such as environment impact assessment reports and masters’ theses.

These data have often been collected **using standard methodologies** and collectively span large space and time ranges. When synthesised, they can provide strong baselines and unmatched insights into India’s ecosystems, beyond the constraints that limit primary ecological data collection. 

**Widening access to these data**, we want to identify gaps and offer broad-scale insights for future forest conservation, management and restoration.
